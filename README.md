# TargetStore Analysis
 
## Overview
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Shopify sales analysis, integrating multiple datasets to evaluate business performance across geographical, product, and time-based dimensions. The dashboard provides real-time tracking of total profit, sales quantities, profit margins, and order cancellation rates. Interactive visualizations allow stakeholders to filter results by state, city, product sub-category, and payment method, revealing patterns in purchasing behavior. Custom DAX calculations were used to categorize orders by profit type and amount range, delivering actionable insights to improve product strategy and operational efficiency.
